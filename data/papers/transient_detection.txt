=== Calcium Transient Detection Methods ===

Bandpass Filtering:
Apply temporal filtering to remove slow drift and high-frequency noise.
Recommended: Butterworth bandpass filter 0.1-5 Hz for typical calcium indicators.
Library: scipy.signal.butter, scipy.signal.filtfilt
Implementation: Design filter with scipy.signal.butter(order=3, Wn=[0.1, 5.0], btype='band')
Apply with filtfilt for zero-phase filtering.

Peak Detection:
Use scipy.signal.find_peaks to identify transient events.
Parameters:
- prominence: Set to 2× median absolute deviation of baseline
- distance: Minimum 5 frames between peaks (prevents double-counting)
- height: Above baseline + 3× standard deviation

Event Characterization:
For each detected transient, measure:
- Amplitude: Peak height above baseline
- Rise time: Time from 10% to 90% of peak
- Decay time: Time from peak to 50% recovery

Alternative: Derivative-based Detection
Calculate first derivative of fluorescence trace.
Transient onsets correspond to positive zero-crossings of derivative.
Use np.diff() to compute derivative, then find where derivative crosses threshold.

Template Matching:
For stereotyped calcium transients, create a template waveform.
Use scipy.signal.correlate to find matches in the time series.
Peaks in correlation indicate likely transient events.

Deconvolution Methods:
Advanced approach using deconvolution to estimate spike times.
Assumes calcium dynamics follow exponential decay after spike.
Libraries: OASIS algorithm, or custom implementation with scipy.optimize
